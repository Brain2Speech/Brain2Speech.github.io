Brain2Speech
====================

Website for the documentations of the Brain2Speech project by the UBC HCT lab.

# About
The main focus of the Brain2Speechproject is to by build and evaluate a new method to control an advanced 3D biomechanical articulatory speech synthesis using neural activation-based models. The end goal is to allow users to create speech and voice sounds through a speech synthesizer using advanced EEG signal processing.

## Algorithms

Cookbook style tutorials for signal processing and machine learning algorithms used by members of the research team at HCT.
