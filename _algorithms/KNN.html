<p >This module is an implementation of the K-nearest neighbours (kNN) machine learning algorithm for classification. In this designed kNN model, the input signals were the original EEG signal without normalization. </p>
<p>A kNN algorithm classifies and object based on its neighbours. An object is assigned to the class most common to k numbers of its nearest neighbours. For example if k is 3, the object is assigned to the class that is most common to 3 of its neighbours with smallest Euclidean distance to the object.  </p>
<p> When running the algorithm with data set (with proper subject name and channel number), the algorithm will print on the console

<ul>
    <li> Current training error </li>
    <li> Current test error </li>
</ul>

And saves a 2D scatter plot of the result in a png file </p>

    <p>  <br> <br> </p>

<h2>Implementation </h2>
<p> The classifier can be called using the <code> EEG_knn </code> module in the classifiers directory. </p>
<p>When the module is called, it will first load data with specified features using <code> EEG_feature_extraction.generate_feature_data </code>.</p>

<pre> <code class = "python"> dataset = EEG_feature_extraction.generate_feature_data("s16",20)</code></pre>

<p> ðŸ“ŒThere are no parameters for this module. Users will need to edit the arguments for the code above to specify the data to be loaded </p>
<p>ðŸ“Œ For more information on how to name and load data save as CSV files see <a herf=\algorithms\EEG_load> EEG_load </a></p>
    <p> Processed data is passed to <code> knn.py </code> which calculates the training and test error.
        Finally, the module calls  <code> utils.plot_2dclassifier </code> to plot the results of the kNN classifier. </p>

<p> ðŸ“Œ Currently, the plot is saved under the name "s16-c20-mean.png" as this is the default example for the demo code. Users can change the figure name and also the path for where to save the plot.</p>
